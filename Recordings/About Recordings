Chunks of recordings for short animated films for the AI tool called Nucleus. The scripts were written by me and my voice was recorded with Audacity. 

The convention is as follows:
- a robot asks the questions - files with 'robo' in their name,
- a person describes the tool - all other files with numbered order.
